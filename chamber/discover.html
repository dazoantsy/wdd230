                <b><u>The Queen's Palace</u></b><br>
                Because of its location on one of the highest hills of Tananarive, 
                this palace is without doubt one of the most beautiful tourist sites 
                in Madagascar. Visible for miles, this palace was once a home to the 
                kings and queens of Madagascar. The Manjakamiadana Palace offers an 
                incredible panoramic view of the surroundings and is close to other 
                important historical monuments such as the Catholic Cathedral of Andohalo 
                and the Anglican Cathedral.

                <b><u>Ambositra</u></b><br>
                In the center of the Big Island is a big peasant village typical of 
                the region. The numerous harnessed zebus that roam the town as needed 
                and its beautiful brick and adobe houses give Ambositra a special charm. 
                There is a soft and restful atmosphere, where the local craftsmen are 
                recognized as masters especially in the field of marquetry and woodcarving. 
                The surrounding villages scattered on the mountains surrounding Ambositra 
                will be an opportunity for travelers to dive into the local culture and 
                discover ways of life very different from those of the urban ones.

                <b><u>Antananarivo (The Town of Thousand)</u></b><br>
                The sprawling capital of the country spreads its districts over 18 hills. 
                Its galloping urbanization offers a diversity of attractions, suitable to 
                satisfy backpackers in search of a total and sometimes brutal change of 
                scenery, as well as more classic tourists in search of historical monuments 
                and traditional architecture. The latter will enjoy wandering through the 
                Queen's Palace district and its old colonial houses, while the adventurous 
                will meet the locals in the Upper Town by wandering through its winding alleys. 
                Perched on the many high points of the district, they will enjoy the unmissable 
                viewpoints that offer travelers incomparable landscapes.

                <b><u>Diego-Suarez</u></b><br>
                Located at the northern tip of the island, the bay of Diego-Suarez, which takes 
                its name from the two navigators who explored it in the 15th century, is in fact 
                an assembly of 4 related bays that open onto a narrow channel towards the ocean. 
                Former French garrison and third port of the island, the city of Antsiranana remains 
                strongly marked by colonization and strives to exorcise its old demons by a festive 
                and multicultural identity. The hinterland, unavoidable, is also worth the detour 
                with its typical fishing villages or the national park of the Amber Mountain.

                <b><u>The National Park of Isalo</u></b><br>
                This immense massif of eroded sandstone of the Jurassic reflects all the diversity 
                of the Malagasy nature. Very popular with travelers, this site is an opportunity to 
                see the famous lemurs in their natural environment. The landscape is the image of the 
                Big Island: wild, multiple and picturesque. The deep canyons dotted with dark caves 
                follow the palm forests that crisscross rivers filled with endemic species. The "Malagasy 
                Colorado" with its breathtaking panoramas and its many crossroads is a trip in itself 
                that will delight trekking and hiking enthusiasts.

                <b><u>The Island of Nosy Be</u></b><br>
                The island of Nosy Be is considered as the unavoidable pearl of Madagascar. And for good reason, 
                its geographical location in the northwest of the Big Island allows it to enjoy a tropical climate, 
                ideal for lounging on its isolated beaches that slope gently down to the sea. Extreme sports 
                enthusiasts will be delighted by the many diving spots along the coast while more bucolic tourists 
                can enjoy gentle hikes through the sugar cane fields. For travelers tired of their journey, Nosy Be 
                is the resort to see and to recommend!

                <b><u>Tsingy de Bemaraha</u></b><br>
                200 km north of Mondorava, the Tsingy de Bemaraha National Park is surely one of the most amazing 
                geological sites of Madagascar. Its majestic karst formations that take the form of tapered needles 
                of several tens of meters in height are now listed as World Heritage by UNESCO. The canyons and gorges 
                which navigate between the rocky masses shelter a unique fauna and flora in the world, among which birds 
                of prey, all kinds of endemic plants as well as a good ten species of lemurs!

                <b><u>The Island of Sainte-Marie</u></b><br>
                On the east coast, Sainte-Marie Island is best known as a refuge and observation point for the inevitable 
                humpback whales that come here to enjoy the calm and protected waters to give birth. Many service providers 
                offer to take you aboard their boats to get as close as possible to the whales without disturbing them. 
                Coral reefs proliferate in the calm waters, attracting many scuba diving enthusiasts and the interior of the 
                island presents an incredible biodiversity and locals always ready to return your smile. A little jewel to 
                see urgently!

                The Marojejy Park in SAVA, known for the impressive mountain that dominates it, the Montagne d'Ambre National 
                Park in the north of the island as well as the famous Tsimbazaza Park in the capital are also among the sites 
                not to be missed.

                <b><u>The Baobab Path</u></b><br>
                Only 20 km from Morondava on the road to Belon'i Tsiribihina, a score of majestic baobabs, called "roots of the sky" 
                by the Malagasy, frame a dirt road that winds through the pastures. The place, enjoying the status of a temporary 
                protected area since 2007, attracts more and more tourists who gather at sunset and sunrise to take pictures of 
                these hundred-year-old trees. To get there, Morondava benefits from regular airlines but can also be reached by 
                road or even by boat. A chance for all the amateurs of grandiose landscapes!
